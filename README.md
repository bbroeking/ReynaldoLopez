# TippingPitches
Data and Exploration of RLopez

Initial investigation into the Statcast data of two White Sox pitchers I enjoyed watching last year. There is some inital
indication that Reynaldo Lopez is tipping his pitches with the release points differing significantly more than Lucas Giolito, 
who had more success in his inital taste of the MLB than Lopez. More to come.
